# Contributing to SKY IT SOLUTION

- Use conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, chore).
- Open a draft PR early; include context and screenshots/logs.
- Add tests where practical. Keep CI passing.
- Do not commit secrets or client data.
- For security issues, email **admin@skyitsolution.co.in** instead of opening a public issue.
